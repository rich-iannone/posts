There are few individuals in the world of data science and analytical computing whose contributions have been as broadly felt as those of [Wes McKinney](https://wesmckinney.com/). For those who may not know the name, Wes is the creator of [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), the Python library that has become almost synonymous with data analysis in that language. He began building pandas in 2008 and, in the years since, it has grown into one of the most widely used open source projects in the entire scientific computing ecosystem. He is also a co-creator of [Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/), the columnar in-memory data format that has quietly revolutionized how data moves between systems and languages without the costly overhead of serialization. He created [Ibis](https://ibis-project.org/), the portable Python dataframe API. He is a member of the [Apache Software Foundation](https://www.apache.org/), a PMC member for [Apache Parquet](https://parquet.apache.org/), and the author of *[Python for Data Analysis](https://wesmckinney.com/book)*, a book that introduced an entire generation of analysts and engineers to working with data in Python.

In short, Wes McKinney has already accomplished enough for several lifetimes of distinguished work. And yet what he has been doing in recent months may be the most interesting chapter of his career so far.

## Two Claude Max Accounts and an Astonishing Pace

Wes has been quite open about his current working methods, and they are looing into in some detail. He has been running two Claude Max subscriptions simultaneously, which allows him to keep multiple AI coding agents working in parallel. The reasoning is straightforward and practical: while one agent is occupied with a task in one project, he can direct the other to begin work on something else entirely. The result is a kind of continuous pipeline of productive output, where the bottleneck is no longer the speed at which code can be written but rather the speed at which Wes can conceive of, direct, and review the work being done.

This arrangement has allowed him to produce an extraordinary volume of high-quality software in a very short span of time. He has described himself as working harder and having more fun building than he has had in years, and the evidence for that claim is clearly visible in his public repositories. The pace of commits, releases, and new project announcements has been something to behold. Let us look at what he has actually shipped.

### roborev: Continuous Code Review for Agents

![The roborev TUI showing the review queue with commit reviews, verdicts, and status.](images/roborev.png){fig-alt="roborev terminal UI displaying the review queue screen with commit reviews and their pass/fail verdicts"}

Perhaps the biggest of his recent projects is [roborev](https://roborev.io/) ([GitHub](https://github.com/roborev-dev/roborev)), a continuous background code review system written in Go. The premise is elegantly simple and addresses a real problem in the emerging world of agentic software development. AI coding agents write code quickly, but they make mistakes, and under the old workflow the review of that code would come far too late to be useful, often after the agent had already moved on to the next task and the relevant context was lost.

roborev solves this by reviewing every commit as it happens. It installs as a post-commit hook, runs reviews in the background, and surfaces issues in seconds rather than hours. It comes with an interactive terminal interface, supports multiple agents including Codex, Claude Code, Gemini, Copilot, and others, and can even automatically fix the issues it finds through its `roborev fix` and `roborev refine` commands. The project has already reached version 0.26.0 with 55 releases, and it has attracted a modest but engaged community of contributors. Wes himself has said that roborev has "totally transformed" his productivity, and one can easily see why: it closes the feedback loop on agent-generated code to something approaching real time.

### msgvault: Archive a Lifetime of Email

![The msgvault interactive TUI showing aggregated email senders with message counts and sizes.](images/msgvault-tui.svg){fig-alt="msgvault terminal UI displaying a list of email senders aggregated by message count and total size"}

[msgvault](https://msgvault.io/) ([GitHub](https://github.com/wesm/msgvault)) is a tool for archiving and searching a lifetime of email and chat messages, written in Go and powered by [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/) for fast analytics over [Parquet](https://parquet.apache.org/) files. It performs a full Gmail backup including raw MIME data, attachments, labels, and metadata, and then provides a rich interactive terminal interface for exploring the archive. It features full-text search with Gmail-like query syntax, incremental sync via the Gmail History API, multi-account support, and content-addressed attachment deduplication. Perhaps most notably, it includes an MCP server so that AI assistants can search and analyze your full message history conversationally. The project has already gathered nearly a thousand stars on GitHub and has a growing community on Discord.

### moneyflow: Personal Finance in the Terminal

[moneyflow](https://moneyflow.dev/) ([GitHub](https://github.com/wesm/moneyflow)) is a terminal-based personal finance tool written in Python that supports platforms like Monarch Money, YNAB, and Amazon purchase history. It is designed for people who prefer keyboard-driven workflows and need to process large numbers of transactions quickly. It uses [Polars](https://pola.rs/) for fast local data operations and provides drill-down analytics by merchant, category, or time period. All filtering, searching, and aggregation happens locally, with no API latency after the initial data download. It is the kind of tool that scratches a very particular itch, the sort of thing that a certain class of technically minded person has always wished existed, and Wes simply went ahead and built it.

### `agent-session-viewer`: Making Sense of the Conversation Trail

As anyone who works extensively with AI coding agents knows, the sessions pile up with remarkable speed, and finding that one conversation where a particular problem was solved or a specific approach was discussed can become an exercise in frustration.

![The agent-session-viewer web interface for browsing and searching AI coding sessions.](images/agent-session-viewer.png){fig-alt="agent-session-viewer showing a web UI with a list of AI coding sessions and a conversation view"}

[`agent-session-viewer`](https://github.com/wesm/agent-session-viewer) addresses this directly, providing a web-based interface for browsing, searching, and revisiting sessions from Claude Code and Codex. It features full-text search across all sessions, live updates as active sessions progress, automatic background syncing, and the ability to export sessions as self-contained HTML documents or publish them as GitHub Gists for sharing with colleagues. It is written primarily in Python with a [Tauri](https://tauri.app/)-based native app component in Rust.

### VibePulse: Watching the Token Meter

![VibePulse menu bar views showing daily cumulative spend and 30-day usage breakdown.](images/vibepulse-today.png){fig-alt="VibePulse macOS menu bar app showing a daily summary of Claude Code and Codex token consumption"}

[VibePulse](https://github.com/wesm/vibepulse) is a macOS menu bar application, written in Swift, that monitors Claude Code and Codex token consumption. It provides a daily cumulative spend view and a 30-day view with per-tool breakdowns, helping heavy users of AI coding agents keep an eye on how much computational resources they are actually consuming. It is a small but practical utility, the sort of thing one builds when one is using these tools so intensively that tracking the usage itself becomes a necessity.

## Fearlessness with Unfamiliar Languages

One of the most striking aspects of this burst of productivity is the range of programming languages involved. Wes is, by his own account, primarily a Python developer. His career was built on Python, his most famous projects are in Python, and the books he writes are centered around Python. And yet the majority of his recent projects are written in Go, a language he says he has never manually written a line of in his life. VibePulse is written in Swift. `agent-session-viewer` includes components in Rust.

This is a point worth dwelling on, because it carries a lesson for all of us. In the era of AI coding agents, the barrier to working in an unfamiliar language has dropped quite a bit. The question is no longer "Do I know this language well enough to be productive in it?" but instead more like "Is this the right language for the problem at hand?". Wes chose Go for roborev and msgvault not because he was good at writing Go code but because Go produces painlessly distributable static binaries with zero runtime dependencies, has fast and deterministic builds, and offers great runtime performance. These the qualities one wants in developer tooling, and the fact that Wes had no prior Go experience was not a meaningful obstacle when an AI agent could generate, test, and iterate on the code.
