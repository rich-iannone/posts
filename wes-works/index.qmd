There are few individuals in the world of data science and analytical computing whose contributions have been as broadly felt as those of [Wes McKinney](https://wesmckinney.com/). For those who may not know the name, Wes is the creator of [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), the Python library that has become almost synonymous with data analysis in that language. He began building pandas in 2008 and, in the years since, it has grown into one of the most widely used open source projects in the entire scientific computing ecosystem. He is also a co-creator of [Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/), the columnar in-memory data format that has quietly revolutionized how data moves between systems and languages without the costly overhead of serialization. He created [Ibis](https://ibis-project.org/), the portable Python dataframe API. He is a member of the [Apache Software Foundation](https://www.apache.org/), a PMC member for [Apache Parquet](https://parquet.apache.org/), and the author of *[Python for Data Analysis](https://wesmckinney.com/book)*, a book that introduced an entire generation of analysts and engineers to working with data in Python.
