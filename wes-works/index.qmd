  A look at the recent and extraordinary output of Wes McKinney, who has been
  shipping many open source projects by pairing his deep engineering experience
  with AI coding agents.

There are few individuals in the world of data science and analytical computing whose contributions have been as broadly felt as those of [Wes McKinney](https://wesmckinney.com/). For those who may not know the name, Wes is the creator of [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), the Python library that has become almost synonymous with data analysis in that language. He began building pandas in 2008 and, in the years since, it has grown into one of the most widely used open source projects in the entire scientific computing ecosystem. He is also a co-creator of [Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/), the columnar in-memory data format that has quietly revolutionized how data moves between systems and languages without the costly overhead of serialization. He created [Ibis](https://ibis-project.org/), the portable Python dataframe API. He is a member of the [Apache Software Foundation](https://www.apache.org/), a PMC member for [Apache Parquet](https://parquet.apache.org/), and the author of *[Python for Data Analysis](https://wesmckinney.com/book)*, a book that introduced an entire generation of analysts and engineers to working with data in Python.

In short, Wes McKinney has already accomplished enough for several lifetimes of distinguished work. And yet what he has been doing in recent months may be the most interesting chapter of his career so far.

## Two Claude Max Accounts and an Astonishing Pace

Wes has been quite open about his current working methods, and they are looing into in some detail. He has been running two Claude Max subscriptions simultaneously, which allows him to keep multiple AI coding agents working in parallel. The reasoning is straightforward and practical: while one agent is occupied with a task in one project, he can direct the other to begin work on something else entirely. The result is a kind of continuous pipeline of productive output, where the bottleneck is no longer the speed at which code can be written but rather the speed at which Wes can conceive of, direct, and review the work being done.

### roborev: Continuous Code Review for Agents

Perhaps the biggest of his recent projects is [roborev](https://roborev.io/) ([GitHub](https://github.com/roborev-dev/roborev)), a continuous background code review system written in Go. The premise is elegantly simple and addresses a real problem in the emerging world of agentic software development. AI coding agents write code quickly, but they make mistakes, and under the old workflow the review of that code would come far too late to be useful, often after the agent had already moved on to the next task and the relevant context was lost.

roborev solves this by reviewing every commit as it happens. It installs as a post-commit hook, runs reviews in the background, and surfaces issues in seconds rather than hours. It comes with an interactive terminal interface, supports multiple agents including Codex, Claude Code, Gemini, Copilot, and others, and can even automatically fix the issues it finds through its `roborev fix` and `roborev refine` commands. The project has already reached version 0.26.0 with 55 releases, and it has attracted a modest but engaged community of contributors. Wes himself has said that roborev has "totally transformed" his productivity, and one can easily see why: it closes the feedback loop on agent-generated code to something approaching real time.

### moneyflow: Personal Finance in the Terminal

[moneyflow](https://moneyflow.dev/) ([GitHub](https://github.com/wesm/moneyflow)) is a terminal-based personal finance tool written in Python that supports platforms like Monarch Money, YNAB, and Amazon purchase history. It is designed for people who prefer keyboard-driven workflows and need to process large numbers of transactions quickly. It uses [Polars](https://pola.rs/) for fast local data operations and provides drill-down analytics by merchant, category, or time period. All filtering, searching, and aggregation happens locally, with no API latency after the initial data download. It is the kind of tool that scratches a very particular itch, the sort of thing that a certain class of technically minded person has always wished existed, and Wes simply went ahead and built it.


### VibePulse: Watching the Token Meter

[VibePulse](https://github.com/wesm/vibepulse) is a macOS menu bar application, written in Swift, that monitors Claude Code and Codex token consumption. It provides a daily cumulative spend view and a 30-day view with per-tool breakdowns, helping heavy users of AI coding agents keep an eye on how much computational resources they are actually consuming. It is a small but practical utility, the sort of thing one builds when one is using these tools so intensively that tracking the usage itself becomes a necessity.
